We both contributed to this assignment and separately implemented our own
PCFGParser. We then combined this at the end.

Angela focused on optimizing the PCFGParser to reach the time and memory limit,
and worked on horizontal and vertical markovizations.

Allen (Aiming) focused on extra credit for annotation techniques such as unary
split, tag split, and yield split.

Both of us worked on the writeup.
